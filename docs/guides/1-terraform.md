# 1. Why Terraform?

If you're new to Terraform in general, it may be in your best interest to start with some Terraform Getting Started Docs. 

[Getting Started](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)

## Why Terraform?

Terraform has been the go-to for Infrastructure-as-code and quite frankly, Service-as-code for several organizations. You can essentially create anything including:
1. Azure Web Apps
2. Virtual Machines
3. Networks
4. Kubernetes Clusters
5. On-prem resources

And so much more...

The idea behind taking infrastructure that you would typically create manually and writing code to deploy it is:
1. You don't have to worry about manual efforts, especially if you have multiple pieces of an environment to set up.
2. You can store the code in source control for anyone to have the ability to work on and contribute to it.
3. Less mistakes happen in code vs creating resources manually because you can integrate tests and checks of the code.
4. You can automatically deploy the code to create resources and don't even have to run the code in an adhoc fashion.

## Why Terraform for Octopus Deploy?
Well, the same rules apply for the *Why Terraform?* section. You want the ability to create resources automatically instead of manually going through a UI.

With Terraform and the Octopus Deploy provider, you can create:
1. Account types (Azure, AWS, UsernamePassword, SSH, etc.).
2. Certificates
3. Channels
4. Deployment Triggers
5. Environments
6. Feeds
7. Variables and variable sets
8. Projects
9. Project groups
10. Lifecycles

And that's just in the beta... (more resources will be added)

Instead of having to create all of those resources manually in Octopus, or adhoc scripts, you can now create those resources in an automated fashion. You can even create the resources via a deployment from Octopus Deploy itself!
